ComplexDiff.jl fully utilize the complex step differentiation to compute accurate and high order derivative.

### Get start

```julia
pkg> add ComplexDiff
```

### High precision derivative computing

While there are [round-off error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error) when we are using [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) to get derivative, by using Complex Step Differentiation, we can obtain extremely high precision derivative.

```julia
julia> using ComplexDiff
julia> derivative(sin, 1, 1e-15)
0.5403023058681398
```

### Jacobian and Hessian

It is also very easy to compute Jacobian matrix and Hessian matrix using complex step differentiation:

```julia
julia> jacobian(sin, [1, 2, 3], 0.0000001)
3Ã—3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.540302   0.0        0.0
 0.0       -0.416147   0.0
 0.0        0.0       -0.989992
```
